            <div>
                <p>The world is full of diseases that pose a threat to human health and well-being. From deadly viruses
                    to chronic conditions, the impact of these illnesses can be devastating. The World Health
                    Organization (WHO) estimates that millions of people worldwide are affected by some of the deadliest
                    diseases, resulting in millions of deaths every year. Some of these diseases have been around for
                    centuries, while others have emerged more recently, posing a significant challenge to global health.
                    In this article, we will explore some of the world's deadliest diseases, their causes, symptoms, and
                    possible treatments.</p>

                        <h1>Coronary Artery Disease</h1>
                        <p>CAD is a condition where vessels supplying blood to the heart become narrowed. This is
                            commonly caused by unhealthy dieting and smoking. The World Health Organization (WHO)
                            estimates that CAD has claimed about 7.4 million lives in 2012. That contributes to about
                            12.8% of all deaths globally.
                            Preventative care is the best care. Eating a moderately healthy diet with fruits and
                            vegetables and making time to exercise are usually suggested habits to help prevent disease,
                            as well as getting regular check-ups from your care provider.</p>

                            oxygen-deprived cells die within minutes of the blockage. According to WHO, an estimated 6.7
                            million lives are lost to strokes in 2012. This contributes to about 10.8% of all deaths.
